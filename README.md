# Browser Automation Expert for LinkedIn Sign-In Flow (GoLogin + Proxy + OTP)

_I'm Sajim Uddin, a Test Automation Engineer with hands-on experience building advanced browser automation workflows. I recently completed a fully automated LinkedIn login flow leveraging GoLogin, Selenium/Puppeteer, and rotating proxies — exactly aligned with your project goals._

## ✅ Here’s What I’ve Built (Demo Setup):
_🔐 GoLogin API Integration_

1. Auto-creates browser profiles with spoofed fingerprints

2 .Injects rotating proxies (IP/Geo/ASN specific)

## 🧠 LinkedIn Login Automation

1. Enters email/password from configfile. If you need I can Enter from external DB (Airtable-ready)

2. Handles 2FA and optional CAPTCHA (manual/email/OTP-based)

3. Confirms dashboard load & success state

3. Logs activity and screenshots for tracking/debugging

## 🧹 Post-Session Cleanup

1. Auto-clears session and deletes profile

2. Prepares clean identity for next account

## 🔧 Tech Stack I'm Using:
